## STM32 Tiny Monitor

### A super tiny monitor for your PC, suitable for your pet ant. 

A python script sends the captured screen over USB to the STM32 microcontroller, then that data i displayed on ST7789 display. I achieved near 6-7 fps, there's a huge scope of improvement.

I made this project because I'm learning USB now and this is a fun project to practice USB stuffs. I still know almost nothing about USB. To get started, follow this tutorial: https://medium.com/@manuel.bl/usb-for-microcontrollers-part-1-basic-usb-concepts-519a33372cc9

The code is not cleaned up, it's a mess for now. I'll clean it up later. Just dumping everything here for now.


### Parts:
- STM32F103 MCU (Bluepill)
- ST7789 SPI Display (240x240 resolution)

### Demo:

Feel free to modify the code and do whatever you want with this useless project.
